		<h1>Motivation</h1>
		<p>
			It's not just about making a game. It's about showing the
			world that F# (and by extension any other functional language)
			can be used for other things than just "financial applications",
			total programs and command line utilities.
		</p>
		<h1>"Just a StarCraft Ripoff"</h1>
		<p>
			<i>Yes.</i> I love StarCraft. I wish I had the opportunity to work
			on it. Sadly,
			<a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/starcraft2/23544726/starcraft-ii-update-october-15-2020">
			it's no longer actively developed
			</a>.
			But I have my own ideas as to what could be done with the
			classic RTS formula (especially in the single player
			department). So while I intend to keep the controls and the
			feel of units as close as possible to SC/WarCraft/DOTA/League,
			I intend to throw in some rogue-like ideas to shake things up
			a bit.
		</p>
		<h1>Version 0.1.0 alpha - December 2020</h1>
		<p><i>The Tech Demo</i></p>
		<p>
			I'm not entirely happy with the quality (I've thrown the UI
			together in less than a month). But I really like feedback, and
			working on something in secrecy doesn't really feel all that
			great, so here we are.
		</p>
		<h1>Future</h1>
		<p>
			I'll keep working on it in my spare time - it's pretty fun. There
			are many things I want to do (some more obvious than others), but
			I'd rather not promise anything here.
		</p>
		<h1>Tech</h1>
		<p>
			F#, Monogame, zero C#... so far
		</p>
		<p>
			I start functional but sometimes performance dictates my choices.
			And so I use algebraic data types, immutable records, monads,
			options (there are no nulls), new types, units of measure, abuse
			tail-call recursion, lazy sequences and so on. But the rendering
			is completely imperative because all other approaches carry a hefty
			performance penalty.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a result, unit behavior (gameplay logic) is almost completely
			unit tested. It took me a while to set this up, but at least I
			don't have to worry about breaking functionality every time I add
			a new feature.
		</p>
		<h1>Entity-Component-System - not everything</h1>
		<p>
			I'm using data oriented design whenever it starts to make sense
			for performance reasons (rendering, particles, not-triggering GC).
			But every time I use it, it increases the complexity of said
			part, so I'll keep its spread to the minimum.
		</p>
		<h1>Why not Haskell</h1>
		<p>
			Rendering is the main part where the ability to write imperative
			code really helps and I'm not sure whether I could do the same in
			Haskell (but I have to admit I don't know it that well, so if
			someone can send me an e-mail telling me how to efficiently
			process 40'000 rendering instructions without tripping up the GC,
			that'd be great). Also, I'm really happy with F#'s compilation
			times - 30 sec for the whole project and just around 3-5 seconds
			for one file change, which keeps development enjoyable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, let us not forget about the C# libraries.. And in a distant
			future, it'd be nice to throw this into Unity.
		</p>
		<h1>Why not C#</h1>
		<p>
			Infinite recursion and coroutines. The ability to write
			suspendable functions (game scripts) without having to worry
			about the cost of lambdas is what the entire AI code is based on.
			I don't have to run a Lua interpreter and write class bindings. I
			can work in the same codebase regardless of what I might be
			doing. Units of measure help quite a bit with my lackluster math
			skills.

			At this state, I want feedback and ideas, so the alpha is free.
			If you want to complain or tell me I'm a man of a weak constitution
			because I didn't use Haskell or that I'll fail because I didn't
			use Go, feel free to do so via e-mail:

		* Mac version requires fiddling - I don't own a Mac. You should be
		able to run it from command line. I don't support this platfrm
		yet, but am providing a dev build you can use at your own risk -
		flawed option is better than no option at all.
