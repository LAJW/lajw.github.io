	<h1>Off-thread rendering</h1>
	<address>Created: 10.9.2015</address>
	<p>
		Here's what we have to work with:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			You can only call graphics APIs from a single, dedicated thread.
			It applies everywhere: DirectX, OpenGL, HTML5's canvas.
		</li>
		<li>
			Calling "End, go ahead and render" is a non-busy blocking call
			that waits for the GPU, so the core can do whatever it wants in
			the meantime.
		</li>
		<li>
			Starting a thread takes more time than rendering a frame -
			30-200ms as opposed to a single frame - 15ms @ 60FPS.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		With that in mind there is one simple trick we can use to speed up
		your game right now - render on a dedicated thread.
	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ol>	
		<li>
			A persistent thread (launch on startup, kill on exit). On-demand
			<code>std::async</code> doesn't cut it because of the startup
			time, which is a shame - promises would be very useful here.
		</li>
		<li>
			Render instruction data structure - for 2D it could be a struct
			with a bitmap reference, position, rotation and so on. But
			generally, we want to replicate and serialize the graphics API
			calls.
		</li>
		<li>2 vectors of rendering instructions.</li>
		<li>A single mutex.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>The flow</h2>
	<p>
		We process the game logic off-thread. We don't directly call the
		rendering API, instead fill the vector up with rendering
		instructions. When the game logic finishes, guarding with a mutex, we
		swap vectors. The main thread only renders and waits for swaps.
	</p>

	<h2>Advantages</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Halving frame times even in tangled, monolithic single-threaded
			games.
		</li>
		<li>Separation of game and graphics API code.</li>
		<li>
			Testability - because we don't have to mock, we can inspect what
			gets rendered.
		</li>
		<li>
			Establishing a base for rendering from more than just one thread.
			Now we can "render" from multiple off-threads and collect the results.
		</li>
